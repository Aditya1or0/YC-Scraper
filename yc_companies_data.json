Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.\r\n- You then jump into the cubic platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and cubic generates diagrams of architecture changes.",

We're an in-person company based in New York.\r\n\r\nToday, clinics miss 30-40% of inbound calls due to staffing shortages. We're solving this by automating complex workflows end-to-end, already serving tens of thousands of patients monthly across virtual care companies, health systems, and a $5B health insurance company.\r\n\r\nWe've raised $5.4M from Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia (scout), and healthcare founders from Ophelia, Medallion, and Counsel Health. \r\n\r\nOur founders bring both clinical and technical expertise—our CEO Ryan is a Stanford/Harvard-trained physician who was on the founding teams of Two Chairs and Ophelia, while our CTO Jeffrey built voice AI at Amazon Alexa and led AI/ML teams at Salesforce.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we transform healthcare communication—creating a future where patients get faster resolutions and providers reclaim time for what matters most.",
